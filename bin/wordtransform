=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<wordguess> is a word-guessing game, a variation on "Hangman". Like in Hangman,
you must guess a word in a certain number of allowed guesses. Unlike in Hangman,
you guess word-by-word, not letter-by-letter. The first letter is always
revealed beforehand so you can have a better idea of the word. Also, unlike in
Hangman, if there is a letter in the your guess word that exists in the answer
word but at the wrong position, the game will not tell you the correct position
but instead will display the letter in the guessed position with an accompanied
C<*> mark. This way, you know that the letter exists but at a different
position.

B<Scoring>. For each correctly guessed word, you get a score. The score depends
on word length and number of guesses. For example, if you guess a 5-letter word
correctly on the first guess, you get 100. On the second guess, 80. And so on.
